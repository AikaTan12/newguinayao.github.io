           <h1>The Extension Project Empowering Community ALS Implementers through Digital Citizenship is a training that enhances the knowledge and skills that I have in terms of digital citizenship. As a teacher and researcher who has great ambition toward progress and development, it is my concern that I should acquire the necessary skills to have a more productive outcome each time I impart new learnings to the learners.
In this program, I have learned about the different branches of what I called when learning about computer systems. This program expands your learning in the areas of computer usage, such as:
the common problems with desktop computers, to troubleshoot the basic problems of a desktop computer: creating and formatting spreadsheets, formulas, and functions; analyzing data and creating charts; using logical functions; and creating a simple web page.
This program helps me in many ways. In this world where technology rises, as an educator, I should be able to learn, adopt, and apply technology because it lessens the time consumption of doing the things that need to be done.
